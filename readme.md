# Generate OpenAPI and Typescript types from JSON Schema

## Motivation

If you manually:

- create API docs
- write validations for incoming body and query params
- write typescript types

Chances are quite high that they are out of sync. Isn't it great if you can generate all of those from a JSON schema? This is my experiment with JSON Schema being single source of truth, then OpenAPI, Typescript types are generated. Body validations are handled by [ajv](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv).

## JSON Schema Structure

In `schemas` folder, there are JSON Schema source files. `common` folder is a place to store files that can be reused across services, and `orders` folder is for this orders service.

---

## Generating Typescript types

[json-schema-to-typescript](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript) converts JSON Schema files to Typescript types. By running `yarn ts`, the TS files are created in `src/schemas`.

---

## Generating OpenAPI files

As described in the [@openapi-contrib/json-schema-to-openapi-schema](https://github.com/openapi-contrib/json-schema-to-openapi-schema) documentation, OpenAPI schemas and JSON schema have discrepancies. It converts JSON Schema files to OpenAPI schema files. By running `yarn openApi`, the OpenAPI schemas are created in `api/schemas`.

In `api/api.yml`, converted schemas files are used as references.

From the `api.yml`, the API documentation is generated by [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc)

---

## Validations

JSON data can be validated by JSON schema. See `src/validations.ts`. Referenced schemas must be loaded by `addSchema` method. Note that JSON schemas are imported not being read by `fs.readFile`. This is because importing is easier to set up if the app is a serverless function instead of a containerized one.

---

## Automation

When any JSON Schema file is changed, the API documentation is also updated and uploaded in S3 bucket through Github Actions.

---

## Todo

- Check if it's possible to reduce duplicate in generate TS files. (for instance, `export type Id = string` is every where...)

- Check how to merge all OpenAPI files. It's ideal to centralize all API documentations from different micro-services.

---

## Developing

- `yarn install` to install dependencies
- `yarn downloadCommon` to fetch common JSON schema from S3.
- `yarn tsc -w` to compile TS files into JS files in watch mode.
- In a different terminal, run `yarn dev` to develop the app. Whenever a file in src folder is changed, TS types and OpenAPI Schemas are also re-generated, and the app is also reloaded.
